This is Bank loan of Customers project where we were provided with 2 datasets with .csv extension files having 39k rows each and the objective was to analyze the growth that bank got within given years in loans. We prepared dashboard using MS Excel, Tableau and PowerBI tools where we prepared interactive dashboards.

The project aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. Loan Amount Analysis by Year: Analyze the distribution and trends of loan amounts over the years to identify any patterns or trend.

2. Grade and Subgrade-wise Revolving Balance: Explore the revolving balance of customers which are categorized by grade and subgrade to understand the credit behavior of different customers.

3. Payment Status Analysis: Compare the total payments made for verified and non-verified statuses to assess the payment behavior of different customer and verify if there are any differences.

4. State and Month-wise Loan Status: Investigate the loan status across different states and months to detect any geographical or temporal variations that may impact loan performance and repayment.

5. Home Ownership and Last Payment Date: Analyze the relationship between home ownership status and the timing of the last payment made by customers to identify any patterns or trends.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to provide valuable insights for contributing to the bank's overall efficiency and profitability.
